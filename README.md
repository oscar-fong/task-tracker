# Task Tracker

Simple PHP task tracker CLI to learn PHP and backend. It stores data in a JSON file and even in a SQLite database changing a line of code.

You can add, update, delete, mark (in-progres or done), and list tasks.

Examples:

- `php task-cli.php add 'This is a task'`
- `php task-cli.php update 1 'This is another task'`
- `php task-cli.php delete 1`
- `php task-cli.php mark-in-progress 1`
- `php task-cli.php mark-done 1`
- `php task-cli.php list`
- `php task-cli.php list todo|in-progress|done`

By doing this project I learned and practiced these topics:
- Programming fundamentals
- PHP syntax and fundamentals
- Arrays
- Files
- Databases
- Control flow statements (if, switch, functions)
- Classes, interfaces and objects
- JSON serialization and deserialization
- Types and variables
